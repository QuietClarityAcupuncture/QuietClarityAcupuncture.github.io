              Traditional Five Element acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice, effective in treating a wide range of aliments. It is helpful for many severe chronic illnesses, complaints that have no easily determined cause, and nagging conditions as well. Event though Eastern and Western medicine are different, they complement one another beautifully.

              Zero Balancing (ZB) is a hands-on bodywork system designed to align your energy body with your physical structure. Simple yet powerful, it focuses on your whole person, even when addressing specific needs. The Zero Balancing process generally takes between 30 and 40 minutes and is performed when you are fully clothed.

              I have been a practitioner of Five Element acupuncture for 20 years. I did my clinical work at and graduated from the Maryland University of Integrative Health (formerly know as the Traditional Acupuncture Institute), in Laurel Maryland where I received a Master's of Acupuncture degree which included coursework at the College of Traditional Acupuncture in the U.K.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have continued to study Five Element acupuncture extensively since 1996 to deepen my understanding of this system of healing. I combine my formal educational training with a strong spiritual practice.

          <h2 class="title">About Treatment</h2>
          <p>
            Acupuncture treats people and not disease. In order to provide the best possible care for you, a comprehensive understanding of your symptoms must be drawn. To do this, your first visit will consist of a two hour in-depth medical and social health history, and physical examination. You are free to ask as many questions as you need.
           </p>

          <p>
            HIPPA laws require that all information you share be held as strictly confidential. In the privacy of my office, you can be sure that nothing you say will be shared outside of that room without your written permission.
          </p>

          <p>
          Initially, you will be seen weekly in order to create an internal harmony, which can be maintained between treatments. The longer an illness has been present, or the deeper it has penetrated, the more treatments you will need.
          </p>

          <p>
            Acupuncture needles are very slender, barely beyond the thickness of a human hair. The finest quality stainless steel, pre-sterilized, disposable needles are used. Most insertions are made just beneath the skinâ€™s surface, and sensations vary from person to person. Sometimes a person feels nothing at all, or perhaps a dull, momentary ache or tingling sensation. An herb called moxa is often applied as well.

          <h2 class="title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <ul>

            <li>
              <h3>Is Acupuncture covered by insurance?</h3>
              <p>
              More and more insurance companies are covering acupuncture treatment. I will be happy to discuss this further with you if you call my office.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>How long will I be in treatment?</h3>
              <p>
                Acupuncture treatment is a process because it treats the root of the problem. Symptoms that have been around longer will take longer to clear. Therefore, conditions that have arisen over many years may be relieved with slow, steady progress. When there is significant improvement, treatments can be spaced out to every other week, monthly and seasonally. Frequency of treatment varies with each individual.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Does it Hurt?</h3>
              <p>
                Acupuncture needles are single-use sterile needles. The needles are extremely fine, barely beyond the thickness of a human hair. The needles are a fraction of the size of a hypodermic needle. They are so thin, clients rarely feel them entering the skin. When the needle connects with an acupuncture point, there may be a brief sensation of heat, buzzing or pressure, at the site, or another part of the body.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Should I tell my Doctor?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, tell your doctor that you are in acupuncture treatment. Today, most doctors recognize the potential benefits of acupuncture and many refer their patients for treatment. Acupuncture is a complement to western medical care. All medications need to stay the same, unless you and your doctor agree to shift them.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Are there any side effects of Acupuncture?</h3>
              <p>
                There are no known side effects of acupuncture.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>What if I don't have anything "wrong" with me?</h3>
              <p>
                You don't have to feel sick to receive benefits from acupuncture treatment. People often come who want to further their own personal growth. Some choose acupuncture in times of major life transitions, such as job changes, divorce, or death of a loved one.
